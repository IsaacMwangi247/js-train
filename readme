**INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRIPT**
-> A web application has the following building blocks:
1.HTML - defines the structure / content of the webpage
2.CSS - defines the appearance of the webpage
3.JS  - enable user interactivity

**What do we use JS for?**
1.User Interactivity - webpage responding to user actions e.g typing, clicking buttons,
scrolling,hovering e.t.c
2.Reactivity - making our pages dynamic -> the page content is able to change itself 
without reloading

**JS can run in two environments:
1. In the browser -> client side JS
2. In the server -> NodeJS


**Where can we write JS?**
-> depends on how much JS code you have to write
1.Internal JS -> witing JS inside a HTML document
        a) In the head section - if you want to run JS before HTML
        b) In the body section - right above the closing body tag (common)
2.External JS -( best way)
----> for a large JS codebase
---> create an external JS file with a .js extension
---->link your external script to html using src attribute in script element

** JS is a high level, interpreted language that makes web applications interactive

1.VARIABLES
-> Named container / memory space used to store values
-> How to declare variables in JS
1. Using the let keyword 
    -> the most common way
    -> used when you want to reassign / change the value of a variable
    e.g let x = 5 // declaration & assignment
        x = 12 // reassignment

2. Using the const keyword
    -> represents constant values
    -> values here cant be changed or reassigned
    -> e.g. const pi = 3.142

3. Using the var keyword - outdated
    -> works just like 'let'
    -> was replaced by let
    -> works in older browsers 

**DATA TYPES**
1.String - sequence of characters / text enclosed in quotations
2.Number - represents numeric values - both whole (integers) and decimal
3.Boolean - represents Truth values - true and false

->How to output in JS?
**console.log()

-> Checking for data type in JS
** typeof()
